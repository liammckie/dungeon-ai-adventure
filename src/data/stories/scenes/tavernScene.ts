Shadows twist along the walls, cast by the weak, sputtering flames of a wrought-iron chandelier. The room smells of stale ale, damp wood, and faintly of iron â€” blood, long dried but never quite washed away. A hearth on the far side struggles against the oppressive chill, its meager flames flickering as though battling against an unseen force.",
